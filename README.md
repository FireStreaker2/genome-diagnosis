# medication-app
Hackathon entry for the IPC Winter Hackathon 

## Try it out!
You can try out this project by cloning and building it locally, or you can head over to the [releases](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/medicine-app/releases/latest) and download the latest APK.

## Inspiration
We're big fans of the YouTuber [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/@markrober), and we got the idea from [one of his videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOWDNBu9DkU)! We wanted to create something similar to it, and we figured it would go perfectly with the prompt provided in this hackathon.

## What it does
This mobile android app allows users to do many things.
* Set prescriptions for easy access
* Set custom reminders with built in push notifications for important things
* Order new medicine
* Keep track of their personal data

## How we built it
We built it using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) as our primary IDE, and [Java](https://www.java.com/). We also used [GitHub](https://github.com/) as source control, so we could have a place to keep our code.

## Challenges we ran into
Whilst two of us already had prior Java experience, none of us knew how exactly to build the app itself. We could think of pseudo-code for how logic would work (ex. use a specific android API in order to do something), but we didn't know where to start from. We spent half of our time researching how Android Studio works (we are vscode users), how the Android API works, and most importantly, how we would want our app to work. 

Another challenge we ran into was team-based coding. In the past, we've primarily worked solo, and just pushing to main whenever we felt like it. But inside of a team, we have to discuss what to do, split up the work, and make sure we don't write any spaghetti code. Working in a team is definitely more efficient, but also more chaotic.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of learning to develop an android app in java, something we have never done before. We were unfamiliar with how android studio worked and knew little Java. Developing an Android app in the amount of time we had was an accomplishment we were very proud of.

## What we learned
We've learned how to develop android apps using android studio and improved our java skills. We also learned the importance of coordination inside of a team, as we ran into many merge conflicts.

## What's next for Medicine App
We would want to have it save your prescriptions locally and have it programmatically generate remainders and orders.

However, we're sadly not planning on publishing this app for production/daily use. A couple reasons why:
* we have no money to buy a developer license
* our coding skills aren't the best
* we probably need to get approved by the FDA, which seems unlikely

This project may still be maintained on GitHub, but only as a side project.
